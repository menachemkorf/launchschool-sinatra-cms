Requirements:

- When a user views the index page, they should see a link that says "New Document".

- When a user clicks the "New Document" link, they should be taken to a page with a text input labeled "New document name" and a submit button labeled "Create Document":

- When a user enters a page name and clicks "Create Document", they should be redirected to the index page. The name they entered in the form should now appear in the file list. They should see a message that says "$FILENAME has been created.":

- If a user attempts to create a new document without a name, the form should be redisplayed and a message should say "A name is required."

Implementation:

- add link to 'new' route within the index page
- create a route '/new', and within it:
  - render a 'new' template, with a form with input text field
- create a route that the form from preveios step posts to
  - check if valid?
    - create a new file with that name in the data folder
    - add message to session that file 'file_name' was created
    - redirect to '/'
  - if not valid
    - add error message to session
    - redirect to '/'
